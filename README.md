# Google VR / Cardboard iOS Demo: 360 Tour

This is an iOS app that demonstrates Google's GVRPanoramaView by taking the user through a tour of mulitple
360Â° panoramic scenes. The user controls progression between scenes by tapping on the screen. (iOS doesn't support the magnetised button used on Android model Cardboard viewers.)

Thanks to GVRPanoramaView, the app can show the scenes either in full screen or, if
the user has a [Google Cardboard VR headset](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/index.html), in (non-3D) Virtual Reality.
